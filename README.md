  ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)
  ## Description
  As a developer it's important to have a high quality README with information about the application, what it's for, how to use it, and how to install it. It's also very important to have the availability to report issues, and provide instructions for other developers to contribute. With all of this in mind I've created a command-line application that accepts user inputs to dynamically generate a professional README.

  ## Requirements
  GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input, WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository, THEN a quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of your project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. WHEN I enter my project title, THEN this is displayed as the title of the README. WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests. WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options, THEN a badge for that license is added hear the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under. WHEN I enter my GitHub username, THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile. WHEN I enter my email address, THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions. WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents, THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README.
