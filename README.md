  ![Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)
  ## Description
  As a developer it's important to have a high quality README with information about the application, what it's for, how to use it, and how to install it. It's also very important to have the availability to report issues, and provide instructions for other developers to contribute. With all of this in mind I've created a command-line application that accepts user inputs to dynamically generate a professional README.
